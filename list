I got banned from your stream today, I'd like to share what I did, and I'd like to say that I got unreasonably banned. Karisa claimed something like Karisa: Artifact doesn't work that way Karisa: You need to have artifact before the debuff is applied
Instead of brining up in chat, since I havn't followed for 10minutes because I got here from lifecoach stream
I sent her a private message
Where i just said that she was wrong about how artifact worked, and gave her an example of when it didnt work like she said
She then proceeded to say something like "i was harassing people in private messages and saying stuff like "she just wanted people to know"
"and that i was probably too scared to take in public
and since that made me upset I sent her the second part about the message calling her out
because obviously I dont want someone to literally post my name and claim im doing stuff I'm not doing
and she continued to claim that i was harassing her, even tho I didnt write anything in pms
so I sent your mod faelyka a message with my messages that I sent to karisa and proving that I did nothing of the sort
and I got timed out for.. "harassing a regular?" or something like that
when I just wanted to prove that Karisa was obviously just writing lies
and thats the messages with your mod
I feel like at no point did I break any chat rules apart from defending myself from false accusations?
I mean you could check my Logs @ Gudomlig and see that I wrote nothing bad at all
I feel like the ban is pretty shitty but I mean, obviously since I don't actively chat in your channel I certainly understand why you'd favour a regular but it's still shitty for me nevertheless
I dont know, I didnt see any appeal process, so I'm sorry if i should've turned somewhere else with this
